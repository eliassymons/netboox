# NETBOOX

This project was created with React, Bootstrap, SASS, and custom components. 

## Functionality

Netboox allows the user to view current bestsellers from the New York Times bestseller list (gathered from a call to the NYT Book API). 

The user can add books to their personal list. They are able to remove books, clear the entire list, or visit a site to purchase the selected book

### Styling

All components are either completely custom, or customized versions of React-Bootstrap components. 

Styling was modeled after the Netflix UI/UX, including color selection, font families, carousel-style, and list organization.
